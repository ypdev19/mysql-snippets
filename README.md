# 📚 MySQL Snippets Vault

A collection of **useful MySQL code snippets** developed and collected over my career. Each snippet is designed to be simple, reusable, and easy to understand.

**Purpose of this project:**

* Serve as a personal and professional reference.
* Share practical solutions with the community.

## Index
- [Count by date range](./snippets/count-by-date-range.sql)
- [Count records per day](./snippets/count-records-per-day.sql)
- [Count occurrences](./snippets/count-occurrences.sql)
- [Compare records in two tables](./snippets/compare-records-in-two-tables.sql)
- [DAYOFMONTH function use case](./snippets/dayofmonth-function.sql)

*I will keep sharing more snippets over time!*

## 🗂 Repository Structure

All SQL snippets are stored in the [`/snippets`](./snippets) folder. Each `.sql` file includes:

* 📌 **Brief description of purpose**
* 📋 **The SQL query**
* 🧪 **Practical usage example**

## 🤝 Contributing & Reporting Issues

Contributions are welcome!

**How to contribute:**

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b snippet-name
   ```
2. Add your `.sql` file to the `/snippets` folder.
3. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add snippet for XYZ"
   ```
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request.

**Best practices for snippets:**

* Use descriptive, snake-case file names: `check-if-table-exists.sql`.
* Keep snippets focused on a single problem.
* Include examples of usage.
* If modifying existing snippets, explain changes in your PR.

**What to avoid:**

* Snippets without explanations or examples.
* Database-specific proprietary SQL.
* Full database dumps.

**Reporting bugs:**

* Open an [Issue](https://github.com/ypdev19/mysql-snippets/issues) with a clear description.
